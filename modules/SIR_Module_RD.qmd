## Introduction and Course Learning Objectives


## Epidemiology Terms

Be Able To:

- Define basic terms in epidemiology.

There are a few basic terms in epidemiology that this learning module will make use of:

- Latent Period: The time between the infection of an individual and that individual being able to transmit the disease to another person.

- Infectious Period: The time during which an infected individual can transmit (spread) the disease to another non-infected individual. 

- Susceptible Period: The time during which an individual is not infected with the disease and can still be infected by it (has no immunity to infection).

- Recovered Period: The time during which an individual, who was previously infected, shows no more symptoms and is immune to further infection by the same disease. 

- Incubation Period: The time between the infection of an individual and that individual showing symptoms of infection; also known as the "asymptomatic" period, as the infected individual during this time experiences no outward sign of infection.

- Disease Period: The time during which an infected individual exhibits symptoms of the disease. 

- Serial Interval: The average length of time between an individual being infected and them infecting another individual, including the intermediate time it takes for vector transmission to occur.

## Introducing Compartmental Models

Be Able To:

- Identify which differential equation models can be called compartmental models.


## The Classic Epidemic Model

Be Able To

- Recall the classic epidemic model's equations.

- Identify the assumptions made in the formulation of a classic epidemic model, specifically in relation to how its parameters were obtained / formulated. 

- Recall what parameters go into the construction of the classic epidemic model, including the typical symbols for each. 

- Explain how the classic epidemic model deviates from reality in relation to the assumptions it makes. 

- Differentiate situations where an empirically deduced transmission rate is more accurate and beneficial to one calculated based on first principles. 

- Discern what situations are best modeled by frequency or density dependent transmission rates, or a combination of both. 

### Formulating Tranmission Rate

### Obtaining Other Parameters

## Solving SIR Equations

Be Able To:

- Solve basic SIR model equations using either mathematical or computational techniques.

- Identify the difference between common methods of solving SIR models, including Euler's method and the deSolve package in R. 

## Basic and Effective Reproduction Numbers

Be Able To:

- Define what the basic and effective reproduction number is and recall primary differences between the two. 

- Interpret the basic and effective reproduction number in context.

- Derive the formula for the basic and effective reproduction number based on their definitions.

## Example of the Classic Epidemic Model 

Be Able To: 

- Identify examples of situations where the classic epidemic model is a useful tool for modeling.

## The Classic Endemic Model

Be Able To: 

- Recall the classic endemic model's equations.

- Differentiate the classic endemic model from the epidemic model. 

## Disease Free and Endemic Equilibrium

Be Able To:

- Define what an equilibrium is the context of a system of differential equations. 

- Find the values where the disease-free and endemic equilibrium occur. 

- Recall when each equilibrium type occurs in relation to R0 and justify it based on the definition of R0.
