<p>For the purposes of mathematical models in epidemiology, such as the SIR model, individuals are classified based solely on their ability to transmit a pathogen, not their diseased status (whether or not they exhibit symptoms). For the purposes of epidemiological models, individuals are generally classified into four primary categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Susceptible:</strong> No pathogen is present in the individual. The individual only has a low level of non-specific immunity to incoming infection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exposed:</strong> The individual has encountered an infected individual and is infected with the pathogen. The levels of pathogen in this individual are too low to allow them to transmit the disease to another person. This individual is hence considered “exposed” to the pathogen but not yet able to infect others with it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infectious:</strong> The individual has surpassed the exposed stage and the pathogen levels within them are high enough to allow for transmission. This individual is no longer just exposed to the pathogen, but can actively spread it now.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recovered:</strong> The individual has surpassed the infectious stage, their immune system has cleared enough of the pathogen that they can no longer transmit it. This individual has some amount of immunity to the pathogen now, but for how long this immunity lasts depends on the specific pathogen.</p></li>

<p>The individual can still exhibit symptoms of the disease while in the recovered category, so it is best to think of this category as individuals who have “recovered” from their ability to spread the infection but not necessarily all symptomatic implications of that infection.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These categories are not exhaustive, and individuals can be classified into further categories based on their stage of infection or immunity status, just to name a few. These four categories are highlighted since they come up most often while discussing SIR models and epidemiological models in general. It is important to note that, at the same time individuals fall into these categories, they can also be classified based on whether or not they exhibit symptoms of infection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Incubation Period:</strong> The individual has been infected with the pathogen but does not show disease symptoms. This is also commonly refferred to as the <em>asymptomatic period</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diseased period:</strong> The individual has surpassed the incubation period and begins to show symptoms of the disease.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although these classifications are more commonly used in a medical, rather than an epidemiological, contexts, we still provide them here to clarify the fact that an individual can still be infectious while in the incubation period and showing no symptoms of the disease. Similarly, an individual can still be in the diseased period and show lingering symptoms of infection while being recovered since their immune system has cleared enough of the pathogen that they are not longer infectious.</p>

<p>By the end of this section, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define what a compartmental model is.</li>
<li>Identify which differential equation models can be called compartmental models.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Generally speaking, compartmental models are a way to represent the flow of populations between different states, known as compartments, using differential equations. Compartmental models show up in a wide variety of fields, not just epidemiology. Any field that can benefit from knowing how information flows between states can benefit from compartmental models.</p>
<p>In the epidemiological context, compartmental models are analyzing how people flow through the four categories, which will be referred to simply as “compartments” from now on, introduced in the previous section: susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered. The relationships between these compartments are often represented using flowcharts like the one seen below.</p>
<p>(INSERT IMAGE OF SEIR FLOWCHART THAT SPECIFICALLY SHOWS LAMBDA INSTEAD OF BETA AS THE FLOW RATE BETWEEN S AND E)</p>
<p>The arrows between these compartments represent the direction of flow (susceptible individuals becoming exposed, exposed individuals becoming infectious, etc.) and the symbols above each arrow represent the <em>flow rate</em> between these compartments with respect to time.</p>
<p>It’s easiest to understand this conceptually through an example. Say in a very large population with the established presence of a pathogen, on average, 300 new people become exposed to a pathogen every day. Of those that are exposed to the pathogen, on average, 50 of them reach pathogen levels high enough to become infectious per day. Then, of those that are infectious and able to transmit the pathogen, on average, 40 of them recover from the pathogen (in the sense that they can no longer transmit it). We can model this specific example with the modified flowchart below:</p>
<p>Which compartments we choose to include depends on the specific pathogen and disease we are modeling. Models where the exposed period is so small it can be considered negligible, or is ommited for the sake of simplicity, are specifically known as <em>SIR models</em> (standing for the three different compartments included in the model: susceptible, infectious, and recovered).</p>

<p>The classic SIR epidemic model is a type of compartmental model that makes the following key assumptions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The epidemic invades the population and concludes itself quickly enough that demographic processes, namely births and deaths, are not very influential to the overall process and can be omitted from the model. This is also known as the <em>closed population</em> assumption.</p></li>

<p>There may be applications of the epidemic SIR model that justify the omission of the exposed compartment since the disease has a negligible exposed period and individuals almost immediately go to being infectious after invasion by the pathogen.</p>

<p>The phrase “per capita” here refers to a rate that is divided among each person in the given compartment. Take the following example: if 3 people are pouring water into a large bucket and each are adding 5 cups per minute, then the per capita rate at which water is being added is 5 cups per minute. To obtain the total rate at which water is being poured into the bucket, we would multiply the number of people pouring, 3, by their per capita rate, 5, to get a total inflow of 15 cups per minute.</p>
<p>A similar logic is being utilized in the SIR equations: the number of susceptible people at a given time, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, is multiplied by the per capita rate they are becoming infectious to get the total rate at which people are entering the infectious category. Similarly, the number of infectious people at a given time, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, is multiplied by the per capita rate they are recovering to get the total rate at which people are entering the recovered category.</p>

<p>The force of infection, or the rate at which susceptible individuals are becoming infected (as well as infectious) per unit time, can be understood and formulated based on first principles in epidemiology as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Consider the perspective of a susceptible individual in the population at any given time. Let’s say this individual makes, on average, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> contacts with other people per unit time. Then, suppose that of those <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> people this individual makes contact with per unit time, the proportion of them that will be infectious is <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{I}\)</span>. Then, of those <span class="math inline">\(c\tilde{I}\)</span> contacts this individual makes with infectious people, the proportion of them that will actually succeed at spreading the infection to them is <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Multiplying these together, we can obtain the per capita (per person) rate which susceptible people are becoming infectious, or the force of infection as follows: <span class="math display">\[
\lambda=cp\tilde{I}
\]</span></p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Although this formulation for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is based on first principles, there are still a number of assumptions being made. Namely:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We assume every individual in the population comes into contact with other individuals at a constant rate <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. This means we assume everyone in the population is equally sociable and, on average, comes into contact with the same number of people per unit time.</p></li>
<li><p>We assume <em>homogeneous mixing</em> of the population. That is, we assume everyone has an equal probability of contacting any other individual in the population. In real life, this is of course not true: infectious individuals are more likely to come into contact with other infectious individuals if they go to the hospital and are less likely to come into contact with susceptible individuals if they quarantine, just to name a few examples.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>The force of infection is calculated in many ways; we just provide one of many possible formulations and rationales here. Notice there are two constant terms in the formulation for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> given above: <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Since these terms are constant throughout time in the model, they are grouped together into a singular term, known as the <em>transmission rate</em>. As it is a constant unaffected by the dynamics of the model itself, the transmission rate—often denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>—is considered a property of the specific disease or pathogen being analyzed and is calculated prior to the construction of the model. We present common methods of calculating <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, summarized in the table below:</p>

<p>By the end of this section, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Solve basic SIR model equations using a combination of mathematical and computational techniques.</p></li>

<p>Two common methods of solving differential equations that are difficult to solve by hand (in an exact method, that is) is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Euler’s Method</li>
<li>The deSolve package in R</li>
</ol>
<p>We will go over each method in this section and the differences between the two.</p>
<section id="eulers-method" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="eulers-method">Euler’s Method</h3>
<p>Although Euler’s Method is widely regarded to be a relatively inefficient method for solving otherwise “unsolvable” (at least in the elementary sense) ordinary differential equations, it is still valued for its simplicity and accessibility.</p>
<p>Suppose we have approximate initial values for the variables of interest (which, in the case of the SIR model, is the number of susceptible, infectious, and recovered individuals at the beginning of our study period).</p>
