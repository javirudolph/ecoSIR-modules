</div>
</div>
<p>For the purposes of mathematical models in epidemiology, such as the SIR model, individuals are classified based solely on their ability to transmit a pathogen, not their diseased status (whether or not they exhibit symptoms). For the purposes of epidemiological models, individuals are generally classified into four primary categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Susceptible:</strong> No pathogen is present in the individual. The individual only has a low level of non-specific immunity to incoming infection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exposed:</strong> The individual has encountered an infected individual and is infected with the pathogen. The levels of pathogen in this individual are too low to allow them to transmit the disease to another person. This individual is hence considered “exposed” to the pathogen but not yet able to infect others with it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infectious:</strong> The individual has surpassed the exposed stage and the pathogen levels within them are high enough to allow for transmission. This individual is no longer just exposed to the pathogen, but can actively spread it now.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recovered:</strong> The individual has surpassed the infectious stage, their immune system has cleared enough of the pathogen that they can no longer transmit it. This individual has some amount of immunity to the pathogen now, but for how long this immunity lasts depends on the specific pathogen.</p></li>

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The individual can still exhibit symptoms of the disease while in the recovered compartment, so it is best to think of this compartment as individuals who have “recovered” from their ability to spread the infection but not necessarily all symptomatic implications of that infection.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These categories are not exhaustive, and individuals can be classified into further categories based on their stage of infection or immunity status, just to name a few. These four categories are highlighted since they come up most often while discussing SIR-type models and epidemiological models in general. It is important to note that, at the same time individuals fall into these categories, they can also be classified based on whether or not they exhibit symptoms of infection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Incubation Period:</strong> The individual has been infected with the pathogen but does not show disease symptoms. This is also commonly refferred to as the <em>asymptomatic period</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diseased period:</strong> The individual has surpassed the incubation period and begins to show symptoms of the disease.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although these classifications are more commonly used in a medical, rather than an epidemiological, contexts, we still provide them here to clarify the fact that an individual can still be infectious while in the incubation period and showing no symptoms of the disease. Similarly, an individual can still be in the diseased period and show lingering symptoms of infection while being recovered since their immune system has cleared enough of the pathogen that they are not longer infectious.</p>

<p>By the end of this section, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define what a compartmental model is.</li>
<li>Identify which differential equation models can be called compartmental models.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Generally speaking, compartmental models are a way to represent the flow of populations between different states, known as compartments, using differential equations. Compartmental models show up in a wide variety of fields, not just epidemiology. Any field that can benefit from knowing how information flows between states can benefit from compartmental models.</p>
<p>In the epidemiological context, compartmental models are analyzing how people flow through the four categories, which will be referred to simply as “compartments” from now on, introduced in the previous section: susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered. The relationships between these compartments are often represented using flowcharts like the one seen below.</p>
<p>(INSERT IMAGE OF SEIR FLOWCHART THAT SPECIFICALLY SHOWS LAMBDA INSTEAD OF BETA AS THE FLOW RATE BETWEEN S AND E)</p>
<p>The arrows between these compartments represent the direction of flow (susceptible individuals becoming exposed, exposed individuals becoming infectious, etc.) and the symbols above each arrow represent the <em>flow rate</em> between these compartments with respect to time.</p>
<p>It’s easiest to understand this conceptually through an example. Say in a very large population with the established presence of a pathogen, on average, 300 new people become exposed to a pathogen every day. Of those that are exposed to the pathogen, on average, 50 of them reach pathogen levels high enough to become infectious per day. Then, of those that are infectious and able to transmit the pathogen, on average, 40 of them recover from the pathogen (in the sense that they can no longer transmit it). We can model this specific example with the modified flowchart below:</p>
<p>Which compartments we choose to include depends on the specific pathogen and disease we are modeling. Models where the exposed period is so small it can be considered negligible, or is ommited for the sake of simplicity, are specifically known as <em>SIR models</em> (standing for the three different compartments included in the model: susceptible, infectious, and recovered).</p>

<li><p>Construct equations for novel compartmental models given the flow rates between each of the compartments.</p></li>

<p>The classic SIR epidemic model is a type of compartmental model that makes the following key assumptions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The epidemic invades the population and concludes itself quickly enough that demographic processes, namely births and deaths, are not very influential to the overall process and can be omitted from the model. This is also known as the <em>closed population</em> assumption.</p></li>
<li><p>Individuals move between the compartments of susceptible, infectious, and recovered only. Other compartments, namely the exposed compartment, are omitted for simplicity.</p></li>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Since this module covers only the epidemic and endemic SIR models, neither of which include the exposed compartment, the terms “infected” and “infectious” will be used interchangeably moving forward. This is because with only the susceptible, infectious, and recovered compartments, once an individual gets infected with the pathogen we assume they are infectious as well.</p>
<p>It is important to note that although “infected” and “infectious” are used interchangeably within the context of this learning module, they are not synonymous all the time. As model complexity increases and the exposed compartment is included, a distinction must be made between the two, as an individual can be considered “infected” but not “infectious” (i.e.&nbsp;they belong to the exposed compartment).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These are not the only assumptions made by the epidemic SIR model, but they do clearly distinguish it from other compartmental models such as the SEIR model, which includes exposed compartment, and the endemic SIR model, which includes the flow in and out of each compartment due to demographics (births and death).</p>
<p>Moving forward, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> will refer to the <em>number</em> of individuals in the susceptible, infectious, and recovered compartments, respectively.

<p>The phrase “per capita” here refers to a rate that is divided among each person in the given compartment. Take the following example: if 3 people are pouring water into a large bucket and each are adding 5 cups per minute, then the per capita rate at which water is being added is 5 cups per minute. To obtain the total rate at which water is being poured into the bucket, we would multiply the number of people pouring, 3, by their per capita rate, 5, to get a total inflow of 15 cups per minute.</p>
<p>A similar logic is being utilized in the SIR equations: the number of susceptible people at a given time, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, is multiplied by the per capita rate they are becoming infectious to get the total rate at which people are entering the infectious compartment Similarly, the number of infectious people at a given time, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, is multiplied by the per capita rate they are recovering to get the total rate at which people are entering the recovered compartment</p>

<p>The force of infection, or the rate at which susceptible individuals are becoming infected per unit time, can be understood and formulated based on first principles in epidemiology as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Consider the perspective of a susceptible individual in the population at any given time. Let’s say this individual makes, on average, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> contacts with other people per unit time. Then, suppose that of those <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> people this individual makes contact with per unit time, the proportion of them that will be infectious is <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{I}\)</span>. Then, of those <span class="math inline">\(c\tilde{I}\)</span> contacts this individual makes with infectious people, the proportion of them that will actually succeed at spreading the infection to them is <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Multiplying these together, we can obtain the per capita (per person) rate which susceptible people are becoming infectious, or the force of infection as follows: <span class="math display">\[
\lambda=cp\tilde{I}
\]</span></p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Although this formulation for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is based on first principles, there are still a number of assumptions being made. Namely:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We assume every individual in the population comes into contact with other individuals at a constant rate <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. This means we assume everyone in the population is equally sociable and, on average, comes into contact with the same number of people per unit time.</p></li>
<li><p>We assume <em>homogeneous mixing</em> of the population. That is, we assume everyone has an equal probability of contacting any other individual in the population. In real life, this is of course not true: infectious individuals are more likely to come into contact with other infectious individuals if they go to the hospital and are less likely to come into contact with susceptible individuals if they quarantine, just to name a few examples.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>The force of infection is calculated in many ways; we just provide one of many possible formulations and rationales here. Notice there are two constant terms in the formulation for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> given above: <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Since these terms are constant throughout time in the model, they are grouped together into a singular term, known as the <em>transmission rate</em>. As it is a constant unaffected by the dynamics of the model itself, the transmission rate—often denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>—is considered a property of the specific disease or pathogen being analyzed and is calculated prior to the construction of the model. We present common methods of calculating <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, summarized in the table below:</p>

<tr class="even">

<td>This method utilizes the formulation <span class="math inline">\(\beta=cp\)</span>, which was obtained using first-principles, and separately calculates appropriate values for <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. The specifics of how <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> are calculated vary widely depending on context and model complexity, but can be found using a combination of logic and predictions for how people will interact as well as real-world data on the transmissibility of a pathogen.</td>
<td>Real-world data is scarcer or there the data available lends itself better to calculating <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> separately rather than fitting an overall <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>.</td>

<p>Putting this all together, we can rewrite the SIR model equations from the <a href="#the-classic-sir-epidemic-model">previous section</a> as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp;= -\beta \tilde{I} S \\[10pt]
\frac{dI}{dt} &amp;= \beta \tilde{I} S - \gamma I \\[10pt]
\frac{dR}{dt} &amp;= \gamma I
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>And for proportions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d\tilde{S}}{dt} &amp;= -\beta \tilde{I} \tilde{S} \\[10pt]
\frac{d\tilde{I}}{dt} &amp;= \beta \tilde{I} \tilde{S} - \gamma \tilde{I} \\[10pt]
\frac{d\tilde{R}}{dt} &amp;= \gamma \tilde{I}

<p>Euler’s method estimates the solution to a differential equation using a series of short, connected linear approximations at a discrete set of times. Although Euler’s method is widely regarded to be a relatively inefficient method for solving otherwise “unsolvable” (at least in the elementary sense) ordinary differential equations, it is still valued for its simplicity and accessibility.</p>
<p>Suppose we have approximate initial values for the variables of interest (which, in the case of the SIR model, is the number or proportion of susceptible, infectious, and recovered individuals at the beginning of our study period).

<p>The accuracy of the solution produced by Euler’s method is a direct result of what we choose the step size to be. If the step size is larger, then the curvature of the true solution will be lost since we are repeatedly taking linear approximations, resulting in an approximate solution that deviates a lot from the true solution curve.

<p>The SIR-type models we are going to cover deal with systems of first-order ordinary differential equations.</p>
<p>Breaking up each word in this description, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“First-order”: This just means we are only dealing with equations involving the first derivative and not subsequent derivatives (the second, third, fourth, etc. derivative)</p></li>
<li><p>“Ordinary”: The unknown function which we are trying to solve for depends only one independent variable.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Since our applications will only deal with first-order ODEs, we will only cover the deSolve function <code>ode</code>, which is used to solve (as you can probably guess) initial value problems (IVPs) for first-order ordinary differential equations.</p>
<p>The function <code>ode</code> takes in the following relevant parameters, summarized in the table below:</p>

<p>Some common misconceptions about <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Must <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> be whole numbers because nobody can transmit the disease to, say, half a person?”</p>
<ul>
<li>No, <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> do not have to be whole numbers because they refer to <em>averages</em>, not the exact number of secondary infections produced by one person. An infectious person might infect nobody or tons of people but the reproduction numbers don’t capture every detail just the overall picture of how many secondary infectious are produced.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p></li>
<li><p>“Is the reproduction number a rate?”</p>
<ul>
<li>No, the reproduction number is not a rate. Take the example of HIV and SARS, which both have <span class="math inline">\(R_e\approx4\)</span>. However, SARS has an extremely rapid spread while HIV is much slower spreading. One individual infected with SARS might cause 4 secondary infections within the span of a week while an individual with HIV most likely infects 4 other people within the span of a few years. <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> don’t tell us anything about the timeframe of infections, so they are not rates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>The formula for the basic reproduction number is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
R_0=\frac{\beta}{\gamma}
\]</span></p>
<p>And similarly, the formula for the effective reproduction number is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
R_e=\frac{\beta}{\gamma} \left( \frac{S}{N} \right) =R_0\tilde{S}
\]</span> These formulas should make sense, as they are multiplying the transmission rate <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> by the average duration of infection <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\gamma}\)</span> to obtain the average number of secondary infections by one infectious individual throughout their entire duration of infectivity.</p>
<p>The point where these two formulas differ is in their assumption about the proportion of susceptible individuals in the population. <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> assumes a completely susceptible population, so it is multiplying the expression <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\beta}{\gamma}\)</span> by an invisible <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Meanwhile, <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> assumes a susceptible proportion equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{S}{N}\)</span> hence the final expression <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\beta}{\gamma}(\frac{S}{N})\)</span>.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand the definitions and intuition behind the formulas for <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span>. The <a href="#the-threshold-phenomenon">next section</a> on the threshold phenomenon applies the reproduction number in learning how to control the spread of infection.</p>
<p>CITATION FOR SECTION: ANDREAS HANDEL BOOK</p>
<section id="the-threshold-phenomenon" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-threshold-phenomenon">The Threshold Phenomenon</h3>
<p>First described by Kermack and McKendrick, the threshold phenomenon refers to the critical point whereby an infection will either invade the population or fail to. To find this critical point, observe the change in the proportion of infectious individuals given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{d\tilde{I}}{dt} = \beta \tilde{I} \tilde{S} - \gamma \tilde{I}
\]</span> Factoring out the <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{I}\)</span>, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{d\tilde{I}}{dt} = \tilde{I}(\beta \tilde{S} - \gamma)
\]</span> If we wish to find the point at which the infection either invades or fails to, we can solve for when <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d\tilde{I}}{dt}&lt;0\)</span> (the proportion of infectious individuals is decreasing, or the disease is “dying off”) and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d\tilde{I}}{dt}&gt;0\)</span> (the proportion of infectious individuals is increasing, or the disease is “growing”).</p>
<p>First, let’s analyze when <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d\tilde{I}}{dt}&lt;0\)</span>:</p>
$$
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{d\tilde{I}}{dt} &amp;&lt; 0
&amp;\quad&amp; \text{(Condition that the infected population is decreasing)} \\[10pt]

\tilde{I}(\beta \tilde{S} - \gamma) &amp;&lt; 0
&amp;\quad&amp; \text{(Substitute } \frac{d\tilde{I}}{dt} = \tilde{I}(\beta \tilde{S} - \gamma)\text{)} \\[10pt]

\beta \tilde{S} - \gamma &amp;&lt; 0
&amp;\quad&amp; \text{(Divide both sides by } \tilde{I} &gt; 0\text{)} \\[10pt]

\tilde{S} &amp;&lt; \frac{\gamma}{\beta}
&amp;\quad&amp; \text{(Add } \gamma \text{ to both sides, then divide by } \beta &gt; 0\text{)}
\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>$$</p>
<p>Reproducing this procedure, we obtain the following similar result:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{d\tilde{I}}{dt} &gt; 0
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\tilde{S} &gt; \frac{\gamma}{\beta}
\]</span></p>
<p>From this, we can deduce that for an infection to even invade the population and start spreading, the initial proportion of susceptibles must be greater than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\gamma}{\beta}\)</span>. This result is what is specifically known as the <em>threshold phenomenon</em>, with <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\gamma}{\beta}\)</span> known as the <em>threshold value</em>. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\gamma}{\beta}\)</span> is exactly equal to the inverse of the basic reproduction number <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{R_0}\)</span>, which means we can also rewrite these conditions like so:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Disease will not invade the population and / or spread:}
\qquad
\tilde{S} &amp;&lt; \frac{1}{R_0}
\\[10pt]
\text{Disease will invade the population and / or spread:}
\qquad
\tilde{S} &amp;&gt; \frac{1}{R_0}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>The simulation below let’s you see the threshold phenomenon in action:</p>

<p>Try changing the initial proportion of susceptible individuals <span class="math inline">\(S(0)\)</span> to be above and below the rounded threshold value (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{\gamma}{\beta}\)</span> ) shown. Notice that the proportion of infected individuals never increases if <span class="math inline">\(S(0)&lt;\frac{\gamma}{\beta}\)</span> but does increase if <span class="math inline">\(S(0)&gt;\frac{\gamma}{\beta}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Connecting this even further to reproduction numbers, we can rewrite the inequalities found above in terms of <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\qquad
\tilde{S} &amp;&lt; \frac{\beta}{\gamma}
\qquad \Longleftrightarrow \qquad
R_e &lt; 1
\\[10pt]
\qquad
\tilde{S} &amp;&gt; \frac{\beta}{\gamma}
\qquad \Longleftrightarrow \qquad
R_e &gt; 1
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>The result above is a really important one: it tells us that <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> is another threshold for determining whether or not a disease will spread. Specifically, if <span class="math inline">\(R_e&lt;1\)</span>, the disease is dying off but if <span class="math inline">\(R_e&gt;1\)</span> the disease is spreading.</p>
<p>This should come as no surprise though, as it can be inferred from the definition of <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> itself: if every single infectious person in the population (assuming the true value for the susceptible population, unlike <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> which assumes a completely naive population), on average “replaces” themselves with more than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> infection, the disease will spread. Moreover, the point at which <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> reaches exactly <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> marks the maximum for the infected population since it is the point at which the disease goes from spreading (number of individuals infected rising) to dying off (number of individuals infected falling).</p>
<p>The simulation below demonstrates how the infected population increases, decreases, and reaches its maximum at different values of <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span>:</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Notice how <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> starts off at its highest (when the population is almost entirely susceptible and it is equal to <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>), then decreases over time to be equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. At the point <span class="math inline">\(R_e=1\)</span>, the proportion of infected individuals reaches a maximum. Then, as <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> further decreases below <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> the proportion of infected individuals starts decreasing as the epidemic “dies off.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Try expanding the window size in the simulation above and observe what happens to <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(t \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> never reaches <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>! This demonstrates another important result: for an epidemic to end, it is not necessary to completely exhaust the susceptible population and attain <span class="math inline">\(R_e=0\)</span>. The epidemic will start to end its course as soon as the proportion of susceptibles dips low enough to where <span class="math inline">\(R_e&lt;1\)</span>. When this happens, the infectious individuals will, on average, no longer be “replacing” themselves with another infectious person despite there still being a non-zero population of susceptible people. If this goes on for a long enough time, the chain of transmission will break because there will be no more infectious people to spread the infection not because there were no more susceptible people to infect. This means that at the end of every epidemic, there will always be some people who were never infected and are still susceptible.</p>

<p>Of course, one of our primary goals is to expedite the natural decrease of <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> to be below <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> as quickly as possible, thus reducing and eventually fully stopping the spread of infection. One of the most effective public health measures to accomplish this is vaccination (CITATION: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12115698/).

<p>At the beginning of the outbreak, when nearly all individuals are susceptible and there are very few infectious, the proportion of individuals immune to the disease or infectious with it <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> can be considered approximately equal to the proportion of individuals <em>successfully</em> vaccinated against the disease. This is because, generally speaking, vaccination confers immunity, though most of the time only temporary, to a disease (https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/how-do-vaccines-work). Since we are analyzing a relatively small time-frame with epidemics, the temporary nature of vaccine-conferred immunity can be safely disregarded.</p>
<p>Notice the emphasis on the word “successfully.” This is because most vaccines are not <span class="math inline">\(100%\)</span> effective; there will always be a percentage of people, though however small, that are vaccinated but can still contract the disease. Assuming a vaccine efficacy rate of <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, or the proportion of people who are vaccinated <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that are truly granted immunity, the proportion of individuals successfully vaccinated is <span class="math inline">\(i=ep\)</span>. We can rearrange the expression found previously to find the proportion of the population <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that should be vaccinated at the start of the outbreak:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
i &amp;&gt; 1-\frac{1}{R_0} &amp;&amp; \text{Minimum proportion of immune individuals i} \\[10pt]
ep &amp;&gt; 1-\frac{1}{R_0} &amp;&amp; \text{Considering i=ep} \\[10pt]
p &amp;&gt; \frac{1}{e}\left(1-\frac{1}{R_0} \right) &amp;&amp; \text{Rearranging for p}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This means that, for a vaccine with an efficacy rate <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, at the proportion of people that should be vaccinated at the start of an outbreak to prevent further spread should be at least <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{e}(1-\frac{1}{R_0}\)</span>. Not everyone in the population must be vaccinated to stop the spread of a disease, an idea known as <em>herd immunity</em>.</p>
<p>However, sometimes herd immunity cannot be obtained. Take the case when <span class="math inline">\(R_0=3\)</span> and the best avaliable vaccine has an efficacy rate of <span class="math inline">\(e=0.6\)</span> (meaning that of the people who are vaccinated, only about <span class="math inline">\(60%\)</span> of them will actually be immune and unable to contract the disease). Using the formula above, we find that the proportion of people who are vaccinated at the beginning of the outrbreak must be at least <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{0.6}(1-\frac{1}{3})\approx1.1\)</span>. However, this is impossible: we cannot possible vaccinate more than <span class="math inline">\(100%\)</span> of the population! This means that, due to a combination of the high transmissibility of the disease and the relatively low vaccine efficacy rate, even if <span class="math inline">\(100%\)</span> of the population were to be vaccinated, there would still be enough susceptible people (i.e.&nbsp;people whose vaccines were not effective) for an outbreak to occur (ANDREAS BOOK CITATION).</p>

<p>Note that the above calculations and statements are assuming ideal vaccination practices at the beginning of an outbreak when nearly all individuals are susceptible and almost none are recovered or infectious. If vaccination is implemented mid-outbreak, when the number of recovered individuals with natural immunity and infectious people are not negligible, the calculations must be modified. In general, fewer individuals will have to be vaccinated than at the beginning of an outbreak since the proportion of susceptible individuals <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{S}\)</span> will be equal to the complement of the sum of: the proportion of people who are infectious, those who have natural immunity due to recovery, and those who are successfully vaccinated.</p>

<p>Recalling the information in <a href="#the-classic-sir-epidemic-model">the section</a> on introducing the classic SIR epidemic model, the classic epidemic model assumes no demographics (births and deaths) in the population. This is because epidemics occur in such a relatively short timeframe, so the inclusion of births and deaths adds unnecessary complexity since so few will occur over this period.</p>
<p>However, epidemic models are not suitable for all disease; there are some diseases that do not conclude their spread sufficiently fast to neglect the births and deaths that occur during that time. This is when the SIR model with demographics, also known commonly as the classic endemic model, comes in. The classic endemic model includes birth and death rates, but makes the following key assumptions about them:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every individual in the population has a natural “lifespan” of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\mu}\)</span> years, where <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the rate at which individuals die due to natural causes</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is independent of the disease and does not represent the pathogenicity of the disease, or its ability to cause death</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>No deaths outside of natural ones dictated by the rate <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> occur; in other words, there are no separate disease related deaths and <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the crude death rate, or the death rate across people in all demographic groups and disease statuses (susceptible, infected, or recovered)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> also represents the population’s crude birth rate as well</p>
<ul>
<li>This ensure that the total population size does not change as time goes on; as such, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is a constant in the endemic SIR just as it is in the epidemic model</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Every individual is born into the susceptible population</p>
<ul>
<li>Although for many disease (like measles for example) newborns are born with passive immunity due to the passing down of maternal antibodies, the average age at which passive immunity is lost is much lower than the typical age of first infection in developed countries. This tells us that it is reasonable to consider all newborns as being immediately susceptible since the time to their first infection is most likely independent of their initial fading immunity at birth. This is not true of diseases that have a very small mean age of infection, however, since an infection can happen as soon as passive immunity ends.</li>

<p>The other assumptions made for the classic epidemic SIR apply to the endemic SIR model as well. We are just simply adding these new assumptions about the characteristics of the birth and death rates in the population. These assumptions are common but it should be noted that not all SIR models with demographics will make the same assumptions as above.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The flowchart for the classic endemic model can be seen below:</p>
<p>INSERT FLOWCHART OF ENDEMIC MODEL</p>
<p>From this flowchart, we can deduce the following equations for the number of people in each compartment according to the endemic SIR model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp;= \mu-\beta \tilde{I} S - \mu S \\[10pt]
\frac{dI}{dt} &amp;= \beta \tilde{I} S - \gamma I - \mu I\\[10pt]
\frac{dR}{dt} &amp;= \gamma I - \mu R
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>And just like before, we can divide every equation above by the constant population size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> to obtain the following equations for the proportion of individuals in each compartment:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d\tilde{S}}{dt} &amp;= \mu-\beta \tilde{I} \tilde{S} - \mu \tilde{S} \\[10pt]
\frac{d\tilde{I}}{dt} &amp;= \beta \tilde{I} \tilde{S} - \gamma \tilde{I} - \mu \tilde{I}\\[10pt]
\frac{d\tilde{R}}{dt} &amp;= \gamma \tilde{I} - \mu \tilde{R}

<p>Notice that the force of infection for the endemic model is the same as the epidemic model (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda=\beta \tilde{I}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The following sections are mostly reviews of concepts covered previously in the epidemic model.

<p>The endemic SIR model can be solved using many of the same methods as the epidemic SIR model. In <a href="#solving-sir-equations">the previous section</a> on solving the epidemic SIR model, we covered two main methods of doing so: Euler’s method and the deSolve package in R.</p>
<p>Both of these methods can be used to solve the endemic model as well, but we will only show an example of solving the endemic model using deSolve since Euler’s method is quite lengthy and is the exact same process as for the epidemic model just with different SIR equations.</p>
<p>Below is a complete example of using the deSolve package to solve an endemic SIR model and plotting the results:</p>

<section id="reproduction-numbers-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reproduction-numbers-1">Reproduction Numbers</h2>
<p>The basic and effective reproduction numbers for the endemic SIR model have the same interpretation as they do for the epidemic SIR model. Refer back to <a href="#reproduction-numbers">this section</a> on reproduction numbers in the epidemic SIR model if you need a refresher of these definitions.</p>
<p>Although they have the same interpretations before, the formulas for the basic and reproductive number are different for the endemic SIR model.</p>
<p>First, let’s formulate the basic reproductive number <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> for the endemic SIR model. We still utilize <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> as the per-capita transmission rate but instead of considering the average time an individual is infectious to be <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\gamma}\)</span> (like it is for the epidemic SIR model), we consider it to be <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\gamma+\mu}\)</span>. On a conceptual level, this is justified because there are now two ways to leave the infectious class: recovery or death. Before in the epidemic model, there was only one way to become noninfectious—through recovery.</p>
<p>Multiplying the tranmission rate <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> by the average time an individual will stay infectious <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\gamma+\mu}\)</span>, we obtain the the basic reproduction number <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> for the epidemic SIR model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
R_0=\frac{\beta}{\gamma+\mu}
\]</span> ::: {.callout-note} This basic reproduction number for the endemic model is generally similar to, but always smaller than, the basic reproduction number for the epidemic model since the natural morality rate reduces the average time an individual is infectious (we now consider the possibility that individuals can die to natural causes while infectious, thus reducing their “infective potential”). :::</p>
<p>The effective reproduction number <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> for the endemic model is quite similar to the epidemic model. It is still found by multiplying the basic reproduction number <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> by the proportion of susceptible individuals in the population <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{S}\)</span> like so:</p>

<p>The inclusion of births in the endemic model means there is a constant “replenishing” of the susceptible population. This allows for the disease to persist in the population in the long-term, unlike the epidemic model which always ends in the disease “dying off.”</p>
<p>To analyze the long-term behavior of the endemic model, we start by analyzing what the model equations look like at <em>equilibrium</em>, or the point when <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dS}{dt}=\frac{dI}{dt}=\frac{dR}{dt}=0\)</span>.</p>

<p>It is important to note that equilibrium doesn’t mean a lack of individuals flowing between each compartment but rather a <em>balanced</em> flow of individuals between each compartment.

<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = \mu-\beta \tilde{I} S - \mu S
\]</span></p>
<p>We can see that for <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dS}{dt}\)</span> to be equal to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, it is not necessary that <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> people are entering the susceptible population (i.e.&nbsp;being born) and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> people are leaving the susceptible population (i.e.&nbsp;getting infected). It is simply necessary that the flow rate <em>into</em> the susceptible population (given by the birth rate term ) is the same as the flow rate <em>out</em> of the susceptible population (given by the infection term <span class="math inline">\(\beta \tilde{I} S\)</span> and the death rate term <span class="math inline">\(\mu S\)</span>).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The equilibrium point of a system of differential equations is found by setting each rate of change equal to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and finding the solution(s) of the resulting system:</p>
$$
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{d\tilde{I}}{dt} &amp;&lt; 0
&amp;\quad&amp; \text{Condition that the infected population is decreasing} \\[10pt]

\tilde{I}(\beta \tilde{S} - \gamma) &amp;&lt; 0
&amp;\quad&amp; \text{Substitute } \frac{d\tilde{I}}{dt} = \tilde{I}(\beta \tilde{S} - \gamma) \\[10pt]

\beta \tilde{S} - \gamma &amp;&lt; 0
&amp;\quad&amp; \text{Divide both sides by } \tilde{I} &gt; 0
