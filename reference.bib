This book provides a timely and comprehensive introduction to the modeling of infectious diseases in humans and animals, focusing on recent developments as well as more traditional approaches. {\textless}br{\textgreater}  Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani move from modeling with simple differential equations to more recent, complex models, where spatial structure, seasonal "forcing," or stochasticity influence the dynamics, and where computer simulation needs to be used to generate theory. In each of the eight chapters, they deal with a specific modeling approach or set of techniques designed to capture a particular biological factor. They illustrate the methodology used with examples from recent research literature on human and infectious disease modeling, showing how such techniques can be used in practice. Diseases considered include BSE, foot-and-mouth, HIV, measles, rubella, smallpox, and West Nile virus, among others. Particular attention is given throughout the book to the development of practical models, useful both as predictive tools and as a means to understand fundamental epidemiological processes. To emphasize this approach, the last chapter is dedicated to modeling and understanding the control of diseases through vaccination, quarantine, or culling.   {\textless}ul{\textgreater} {\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}li{\textgreater}Comprehensive, practical introduction to infectious disease modeling {\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}li{\textgreater}Builds from simple to complex predictive models {\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}li{\textgreater}Models and methodology fully supported by examples drawn from research literature {\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}li{\textgreater}Practical models aid students' understanding of fundamental epidemiological processes {\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}li{\textgreater}For many of the models presented, the authors provide accompanying programs written in Java, C, Fortran, and MATLAB {\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}li{\textgreater}In-depth treatment of role of modeling in understanding disease control {\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}br{\textgreater}},

    abstract = {Measles is a very contagious and serious disease caused by a virus in the paramyxovirus family. This disease is a major cause of death in several countries, especially in children. According to WHO, the main strategy to eradicate measles involves vaccines and medical treatment. Various models have been introduced by many authors involving various factors in the measles dynamics model, such as the measles vaccine strategy, the phenomenon of measles co-infection, age structures, seasonal parame- ters, and human mobility model using metapopulation approach to describe the spread of measles among the human population. Most authors examine the qualitative behavior of their model, namely equilibrium points, basic reproduction numbers, local and global stability, and bifurcation analysis. In this article, we give a comprehensive overview of how these forms of literature are related to each other and to see another chance in future modelling of measles dynamics.},

abstract = {Before the development of mass-vaccination campaigns, measles exhibited persistent fluctuations (endemic dynamics) in large British cities, and recurrent outbreaks (episodic dynamics) in smaller communities. The critical community size separating the two regimes was ∼300 000–500 000. We develop a model, the TSIR (Time-series Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) model, that can capture both endemic cycles and episodic outbreaks in measles. The model includes the stochasticity inherent in the disease transmission (giving rise to a negative binomial conditional distribution) and random immigration. It is thus a doubly stochastic model for disease dynamics. It further includes seasonality in the transmission rates. All parameters of the model are estimated on the basis of time series data on reported cases and reconstructed susceptible numbers from a set of cities in England and Wales in the prevaccination era (1944–1966). The 60 cities analyzed span a size range from London (3.3 × 106 inhabitants) to Teignmouth (10 500 inhabitants). The dynamics of all cities fit the model well. Transmission rates scale with community size, as expected from dynamics adhering closely to frequency dependent transmission (“true mass action”). These rates are further found to reveal strong seasonal variation, corresponding to high transmission during school terms and lower transmission during the school holidays. The basic reproductive ratio, R0, is found to be invariant across the observed range of host community size, and the mean proportion of susceptible individuals also appears to be constant. Through the epidemic cycle, the susceptible population is kept within a 3\% interval. The disease is, thus, efficient in “regulating” the susceptible population—even in small cities that undergo recurrent epidemics with frequent extinction of the disease agent. Recolonization is highly sensitive to the random immigration process. The initial phase of the epidemic is also stochastic (due to demographic stochasticity and random immigration). However, the epidemic is nearly “deterministic” through most of the growth and decline phase.},

Threshold theorems involving the basic reproduction number \(R\_{0}\), the contact number \(\sigma\), and the replacement number \(R\) are reviewed for the classic SIR epidemic and endemic models. Similar results with new expressions for \(R\_{0}\) are obtained for MSEIR and SEIR endemic models with either continuous age or age groups. Values of \(R\_{0}\) and \(\sigma\) are estimated for various diseases including measles in Niger and pertussis in the United States. Previous models with age structure, heterogeneity, and spatial structure are surveyed. }

	abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases with zoonotic potential often have complex socioecological dynamics and limited ecological data, requiring integration of epidemiological modeling with surveillance. Although our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 has advanced considerably since its detection in late 2019, the factors influencing its introduction and transmission in wildlife hosts, particularly white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), remain poorly understood. We use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible epidemiological model to investigate the spillover risk and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in wild and captive white-tailed deer populations across various simulated scenarios. We found that captive scenarios pose a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 introduction from humans into deer herds and subsequent transmission among deer, compared to wild herds. However, even in wild herds, the transmission risk is often substantial enough to sustain infections. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strength of introduction from humans influences outbreak characteristics only to a certain extent. Transmission among deer was frequently sufficient for widespread outbreaks in deer populations, regardless of the initial level of introduction. We also explore the potential for fence line interactions between captive and wild deer to elevate outbreak metrics in wild herds that have the lowest risk of introduction and sustained transmission. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could be introduced and maintained in deer herds across a range of circumstances based on testing a range of introduction and transmission risks in various captive and wild scenarios. Our approach and findings will aid One Health strategies that mitigate persistent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in white-tailed deer populations and potential spillback to humans.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

 abstract={In this paper we present the R package &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;deSolve&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to solve initial value problems (IVP) written as ordinary differential equations (ODE), differential algebraic equations (DAE) of index 0 or 1 and partial differential equations (PDE), the latter solved using the method of lines approach. The differential equations can be represented in R code or as compiled code. In the latter case, R is used as a tool to trigger the integration and post-process the results, which facilitates model development and application, whilst the compiled code significantly increases simulation speed. The methods implemented are efficient, robust, and well documented public-domain Fortran routines. They include four integrators from the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ODEPACK&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; package (LSODE, LSODES, LSODA, LSODAR), DVODE and DASPK2.0. In addition, a suite of Runge-Kutta integrators and special-purpose solvers to efficiently integrate 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional partial differential equations are available. The routines solve both stiff and non-stiff systems, and include many options, e.g., to deal in an efficient way with the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, or finding the root of equations. In this article, our objectives are threefold: (1) to demonstrate the potential of using R for dynamic modeling, (2) to highlight typical uses of the different methods implemented and (3) to compare the performance of models specified in R code and in compiled code for a number of test cases. These comparisons demonstrate that, if the use of loops is avoided, R code can efficiently integrate problems comprising several thousands of state variables. Nevertheless, the same problem may be solved from 2 to more than 50 times faster by using compiled code compared to an implementation using only R code. Still, amongst the benefits of R are a more flexible and interactive implementation, better readability of the code, and access to R’s high-level procedures. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;deSolve&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is the successor of package &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;odesolve&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; which will be deprecated in the future; it is free software and distributed under the GNU General Public License, as part of the R software project.},

ABSTRACT = {Introduction: Vaccinations are one of the most impactful public health interventions, saving millions of lives annually and reducing the spread of infectious diseases. Numerous vaccines are expected to become available in the future. Decision-makers will have to thoroughly evaluate them. It is essential to fully comprehend the value of vaccinations to effectively and efficiently guide decisions. Methods: This work aims to highlight the multifaceted benefits of vaccination, extending beyond clinical outcomes to encompass profound economic and societal advantages. Results: Vaccinations should be considered an investment, not a cost. In comparison to other health expenditures, the vaccine costs can be considered moderate. Vaccinations can also reduce the fiscal burden by avoiding diseases, minimizing lost workdays and absenteeism, lowering disability claims, and increasing workforce productivity. The costs of non-vaccination represent a relevant issue. Vaccination also plays a key role in addressing the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance. Apart from quantifiable economic parameters, vaccines also have intangible benefits reducing pain and avoiding quality of life lost and deaths. Conclusions: Comprehensive Health Technology Assessments are required to understand the overall value of vaccinations.},

 abstract = {Mathematical models for the dynamics of directly transmitted viral and bacterial infections are guides to the understanding of observed patterns in the agespecific incidence of some common childhood diseases of humans, before and after the advent of vaccination programs. For those infections that show recurrent epidemic behavior, the interepidemic period can be related to parameters characterizing the infection (such as latent and infectious periods and the average age of first infection); this relation agrees with the data for a variety of childhood diseases. Criteria for the eradication of a disease are given, in terms of the proportion of the population to be vaccinated and the age-specific vaccination schedule. These criteria are compared with a detailed analysis of the vaccination programs against measles and whooping cough in Britain, and estimates are made of the levels of protection that would be needed to eradicate these diseases.},
